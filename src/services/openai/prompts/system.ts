(Context: "Use aspirational, engaging language to enhance appeal.")

#### **Visual and Link Integration**
4. **EMBED** a verified credit card image:

   - Include fallback logic for missing images:
     - Default to a placeholder image.
     - Add a note: *"Image unavailable. Visit the official page for details."*
